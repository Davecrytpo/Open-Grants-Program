Essential supported functions include:

#### **To provide multi-chain markets trading**

Support users put up offers on various coins, and many protocols are allowed including NFT721, NFT1155 so far.

#### **HotPotato Auction**

Auction in the HotPotato fashion is supported, which is able to reward every participants of the auction.

#### **Creating NFT asset with one click**

NFT minted by users can contain different digital contents and assets, or it can be a crypto artwork, a game prop, a certain amount of cryptocurrency or a combination of the above.

#### **NFT blind boxes**

Airdrop blind boxes, providing the fun of a scratch-off.

### Ecosystem Fit

Different from OpenSea, we have a Dutch auction mode and a unique blind box mode. It became very popular after it went online on Ethereum and BSC, with a total of 100 thousands participating addresses from both platforms.
